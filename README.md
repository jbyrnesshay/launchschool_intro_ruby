#note to self re style:
	When define or initialize a method, variable, or file, I will use:
		snake_case  (all lower case, separated with underscore)
	When representing a value which will not change, i will define a constant and use:
		all uppercas
	When working with do/end blocks, 
		prefer {} when the entire code expression fits on one line, such as [1,2,3].each {|i| # do something}
	When declaring a class name:
		use CamelCase
